Fun with canvas
=======================
Making funcky bobble all over the screen
--------------------------------------------
 Code is added already. Please download and have fun with canvas. Try to modify the dx , dy and radius value to have more fun.
 You can find the best use of object oriented Js for setting and getting the properties as well as providing the methods for the bobbles
 . On hovering over the bobble i have added a event as well as on the resize of screen the bobble will adjust by itself. 
 
 * Making the gravity is my next target.
